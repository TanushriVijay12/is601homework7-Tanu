# Project Overview
The Advanced Python Calculator is a command-line application and it demonstrates:

1. A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface for performing arithmetic operations.
2. A plugin system for dynamic command loading and extension of functionality.
3. Pandas integration for managing and persisting calculation history.
4. Logging using Python’s built-in logging module, with log levels and destinations controlled by environment variables.
5. The use of multiple Design Patterns—such as Command, Facade, Singleton, and Strategy/Factory—to create a scalable, maintainable codebase.
6. Comprehensive testing with Pytest, including coverage reports and code quality checks with Pylint.
